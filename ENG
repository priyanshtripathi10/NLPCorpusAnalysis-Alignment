Humans have always been curious about the world around them.  
The night sky with its bright celestial objects has fascinated humans since time immemorial.  
The regular repetitions of the day and night, the annual cycle of seasons, the eclipses, the tides, the volcanoes, the rainbow have always been a source of wonder.  
The world has an astonishing variety of materials and a bewildering diversity of life and behavior.  
The inquiring and imaginative human mind has responded to the wonder and awe of nature in different ways.  
One kind of response from the earliest times has been to observe the physical environment carefully, look for any meaningful patterns and relations in natural phenomena, and build and use new tools to interact with nature.  
This human endeavor led, in course of time, to modern science and technology.  
The word Science originates from the Latin verb Scientia meaning 'to know'.  
The Sanskrit word Vijnan and the Arabic word Ilm convey similar meaning, namely 'knowledge'.  
Science, in a broad sense, is as old as human species.
